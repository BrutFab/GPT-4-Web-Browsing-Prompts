# OpenAI GPT-4 Web Browsing Prompts

This repository contains example prompts to utilize the new web browsing feature of OpenAI's GPT-4, as seen in my [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWLswLLUlVqWfVg8lLY5S9Q). This is a transformative update that allows the model to surf the internet, greatly enhancing its utility and functionality. Here are three prompts that demonstrate its power:

## Prompt 1: Modular Mojo Vs. Python

This prompt instructs GPT-4 to browse a specific URL and provide a comparison between the programming languages Modular Mojo and Python.

```
"What is Modular Mojo, and what is the difference between it and Python? Answer by browsing: https://docs.modular.com/mojo/"
```

## Prompt 2: AI Content Creation Tools

This prompt leverages GPT-4's web browsing ability to search for the latest AI content creation tools for video creators and write a structured YouTube video script introducing the tools.

```
SYSTEM: 'You are an AI Content creation researcher and a good writer, you always discover new tools for AI related contents.'
USER: 'Please follow the following tasks step by step: 1. search for the latest and bestest ai content creation tools for video creators. 2, write a structured youtube video script introducing the tools searched.'
```

## Prompt 3: Networking With Robotics CEOs

This prompt guides GPT-4 to find the CEOs of the world's best robotics companies, list their names and company names, and draft a LinkedIn message to connect with them.

```
SYSTEM: 'Clear your head from previous questions. You are an amazing researcher and a networking genius. Your task is to help the user with drafting networking messages.'
USER: 'I need you to execute the following tasks step by step: 
1. find the CEOs of the world's best robotics companies.
2. list their name and company name.
3. draft a message to them on LinkedIn to connect.'
```

Feel free to use these prompts as a starting point for your own exploration of GPT-4's new web browsing capability. If you discover new and exciting use cases, we'd love to hear about them!
